title: Learner Profile
---

This lesson is designed for researchers who want to perform a complete RNA-seq analysis using standard tools and reproducible workflows. Learners are typically graduate students, postdocs, research staff, or faculty working with sequencing-based gene expression data.

### Background and Experience

* Familiarity with basic biological concepts including genes, transcripts and expression
* Some exposure to the command line (navigating directories, running commands)
* Little or no prior experience with RNA-seq data analysis
* No requirement for programming experience beyond running provided scripts

### Motivations

* Analyze RNA-seq data from their own experiments
* Learn standard QC, alignment, quantification and differential expression workflows
* Understand how to interpret results and generate publication-ready figures
* Gain exposure to reproducible analysis approaches on HPC systems

### Needs and Goals

* Know how to evaluate read quality
* Learn how to align reads and generate count matrices
* Perform differential expression analysis using established statistical frameworks
* Understand normalization, modeling assumptions and interpretation of outputs
* Learn best practices for organizing projects and making workflows reproducible

### Challenges

* Managing multiple tools and file formats
* Understanding statistical concepts such as dispersion, FDR and normalization
* Navigating HPC environments and resource allocation
* Interpreting QC metrics and identifying technical artifacts

### Computing Requirements

* Access to a Unix-like shell environment (local or cluster)
* Ability to run command-line tools and R-based analysis
* Internet browser for visual summaries and documentation access
